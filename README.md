The C# module in my first year introduced me to programming in a uniquely engaging way through a series of "Kara" exercises. These exercises were pivotal in familiarizing me with the basics of C#, as they involved writing functions that commanded a character named Kara to perform specific actions.

### Kara Exercises
The entire suite of Kara exercises, along with the worlds needed for testing, is located [here](Kara/Form1.SteuerungKara.cs). For those interested in running a specific exercise, corresponding worlds can be found in the UserWorlds folder, facilitating an interactive learning experience.

### Transition to Real-World Scenarios
Building upon the foundational skills acquired from the Kara exercises, the course progressed to more realistic programming scenarios, including debugging. An illustrative debugging exercise can be found [here](AB_Debuggen/AB_Debuggen/Program.cs), which challenges the application of debugging skills in a structured environment.

### Beyond Basics - Diverse Exercises
The journey didn't stop at debugging. The curriculum expanded to include a variety of programming exercises aimed at enhancing our function creation abilities and even developing a memory game. These exercises are accessible [here](Exercises/Program.cs), showcasing a broad spectrum of applications and challenges encountered in C# programming.
